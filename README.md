# AaC-VSCode
A VS Code extension with supporting AaC language plugins.

## Motivation
Earlier versions of AaC utilized a mono-repo strategy that bundled the VS Code extension with the
core AaC language definition.  While this did force more universal integration consistency, it
also created complexities for managing the core AaC language definition and forced a much
wider inclusion of 3rd party dependencies into the AaC SBOM than we'd like.

This repository is currently empty, serving as a place holder to support a refactor of the
VS Code content from the main repository into this one.  We'll continue discussions with the
team to ensure this is the desired path forward before continuing.
